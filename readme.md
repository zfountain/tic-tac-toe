#tic-tac-toe

##Technologies Used
This game was built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript and jQuery for game functionality. Thanks to Eric Meyer (meyerweb.com) for the CSS reset file.

##Approach
My approach was to build out structure and style prior to programming the game. I knew each square would correspond to a specific placement of X or O, so I added a unique ID for each square. I included a combination of JavaScript and jQuery programming, primarily using jQuery for adding Xs and Os and determining winners, and JavaScript conditionals for finding a winner or determining a draw.

##Installation Instructions
When downloading the files, maintain the existing folder structure to assure .css and .js files link correctly. 

To play this game, the user must have JavaScript enabled in the web browser.

##Unsolved Problems
I have a current issue with scope (I think) within JS/jQuery. If X wins with a full board, the "It's a draw!" alert displays after the "X wins!" alert.
